# Motivation

Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has emerged as a promising approach for developing complex systems in a cost-effective and efficient manner. It promotes the systematic use of models throughout the engineering process, facilitating effective representation of system artifacts and supporting various activities involved in development.

# Objective
The 1st Workshop on MBSE aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from industry and academia interested in the use of models and modeling for systems engineering. The workshop provides a platform to share experiences, best practices, and solutions, as well as discuss the latest advances, challenges, and future directions in MBSE and associated languages (e.g., SysML and Arcadia/Capella), techniques, and tools.

# Intended audience
The intended audience consists of all people from industry or academia who are interested in the use of models for systems engineering.
